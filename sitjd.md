# Sword in the Jungle Deep
Driven by the abusive schemes of Warmage Czercic, whose cruelty is checked only by his avarice, a band of hapless prisoners is forced into Erset La Tari: a vicious jungle teeming with monstrous wildlife and rumored to conceal bountiful treasures. Will they unearth an ancient angelic secret or will they perish in the wilderness, forgotten exiles of a decadent city?
Sword in the Jungle Deep is an introductory adventure for a party of level 0 characters, meant to challenge both new and experienced players. This stand-alone adventure can also be used to start or augment your own home-brew campaign.

## Behind the Screens
For Francisco Duarte, DCC provides a chance to explore disparity. It is designed to be dynamic, but not necessarily “fair”, at least not in the traditional sense. Unfair circumstances contrasted against tremendous potential took hold of the author's imagination. In his words, 
>When I was imagining the world of Caster's Crossing, I imagined these organizations with nigh-monolithic power, and having the players starting with these characters who are expendable, and eventually evolving into something more was something that quickly captured my imagination and made me think, 'I wish I could start a campaign like this!'

## About the author
Francisco Duarte hails from Coimbra, Portugal and has harnessed the power of the internet to expand his horizons. Working and playing with The Keep Studios (based in the U.S.) he was exposed to DCC. “When I was young I really enjoyed Philip Pullman's novels and H.P. Lovecraft's short stories, and the way authors like them weaved mythological and mundane in strange, yet wondrous, ways. Back then I started writing stories about such themes but never knew what to do with them. Publishing in that form felt incomplete, somehow. When I met the rest of the gang at The Keep Studios and we started talking about producing adventures for Dungeon Crawl Classics, suddenly those old unfinished stories had a new purpose. I could use the weirdness of my younger years as a writer to bring new experiences to the arsenal of Game Masters everywhere, with strange worlds and characters they and their players could explore.”

>Vladimir the elf, arrogant bastard that he was, decided in his infinite wisdom that nothing could possibly go wrong with what appeared to be his ticket out of here. Ambling up the pedestal, he noted his compatriots standing far behind. 'Cowards!' he thought to himself, 'They must truly love it here... Well, not me!'
Vlad approached the gleaming red artifact with a grin that would not last long. Within moments of entering the circle of stumps, he was ripped off his feet into the air. With horrified expressions, his fellow prisoners watched on as he was held in the air by the roots of the stump nearest to the elf. Seconds later, he was torn asunder, and then squeezed into a fine paste, as if for good measure. - Play Tester

Haven't your players always wanted an authentically capricious exiled prisoner survival experience? Of course they have! They just don't know it yet... It's up to you to show them _real_ adventure.
